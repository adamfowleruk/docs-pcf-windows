This topic describes how to install and configure the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows tile. The PAS for Windows tile installs Windows cells on your PCF deployment.

## <a id='ert'></a> Step 1: Confirm Shared PAS Tile Settings

There are two settings in the **Pivotal Application Service** tile that affect the Windows cells installed by the **PAS for Windows** tile. Configure these settings as desired:

* In the **Networking** section, if you select the **Disable SSL certificate verification for this environment** checkbox, SSL certificate verification is disabled for Windows cells.
* In the **System Logging** section, if you configure an external syslog aggregator, logs are drained from Windows cells as well as non-Windows cells.

##<a id='install'></a> Step 2: Install the Tile

1. Download the **Pivotal Application Service for Windows** product file from the product page of [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pas-windows).

1. From the same [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pas-windows) page, download the **PAS for Windows File System Injector** tool for your workstation OS, Windows, Linux, or Mac. The Injector tool is an executable binary `winfs-injector` that adds the Windows Server container base image into the product file. This step requires internet access and can take up to 20 minutes. Note that you will need the `git` and `tar` (BSD) executables on your `%PATH%` in order in order to run the `winfs-injector`. Note, to use the injector on a Windows machine, `winfs-injector.exe`, the included utility, `tar.exe`, must be copied to a folder in your `%PATH%`. For example, `C:\Windows`.

1. Run `winfs-injector` with the following options, replacing `PAS-WINDOWS-DOWNLOADED.pivotal` with the path to the downloaded **PAS for Windows** product file and `PAS-WINDOWS-INJECTED.pivotal` with a desired output path for the importable product file:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ winfs-injector --input-tile PAS-WINDOWS-DOWNLOADED.pivotal \
    --output-tile PAS-WINDOWS-INJECTED.pivotal
    </pre>
  For troubleshooting the `winfs-injector`, see [PAS for Windows File System Injector Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.html#winfs-injector-issues).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**.

1. Select the importable `PAS-WINDOWS-INJECTED.pivotal` file on your workstation. **PAS for Windows** appears in the product list under **Import a Product**.

1. Click **+** under the **PAS for Windows** product listing to add it to your staging area.

##<a id='config'></a> Step 3: Configure the Tile

1. Click the newly added **PAS for Windows** tile.

    <%= image_tag('pcf-windows-tile-orange.png') %>

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks** or **Assign Networks**. The name of the section varies depending on your IaaS.

1. Assign your AZs and networks and click **Save**.

1. Click **VM Options**.

    <%= image_tag('vm-options.png') %>

1. Specify how you would like to manage the password for the user called "Administrator" for your Windows VMs.
  * The default option is to **Use the Windows default password**, which randomizes the password for this user and the password is not retrievable by an operator.
  * **Set the password** will set the *same* password for the user called "Administrator" for every Windows cell; this can be used to access any Windows cell (e.g. RDP sessions).

1. (Optional) Select the **BETA: Enable BOSH-native SSH support on all VMs** checkbox to start the Microsoft beta port of the OpenSSH daemon on port 22 on all VMs. Users will be able to SSH onto Windows VMs with the `bosh ssh` command, and enter a CMD terminal as an administrator user. They can then run `powershell.exe` to start a PowerShell session.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This feature is beta and not considered production-ready.</p>

1. (Optional) If you want all VMs to support connection through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), click **Enable Remote Desktop Protocol**.

1. (Optional) If you want to configure a Key Management Service (KMS) that your volume-licensed Windows cell can register with, perform the following steps:
    1. Click **Enable**
    2. For the **Host** field, enter the KMS hostname.
    3. For the **Port** field, enter the port number. The default port number is `1688`.

1. (Optional) To deploy your PAS for Windows application workloads to an isolation segment, click **Application Containers** and perform the steps in the [Assign a Tile to an Isolation Segment](./isolation.html#assign-isolation) section below.

1. (Optional) To configure Windows cells to send Windows Event logs to an external syslog server, click **System Logging** and perform the steps in the [Send Cell Logs to a Syslog Server](./troubleshooting.html#syslog) section.

1. Click **Errands**. Pivotal recommends that you set the **Install HWC Buildpack Errand** to **On**. This ensures that you receive the most up-to-date HWC Buildpack.

1. Click **Save**.

##<a id='resources'></a> Step 4: Configure Tile Resources

To configure your tile resources, navigate to the **Resource Config** pane of the PAS for Windows tile and use the drop-down menus for each job.

For information about configuring the disk size of your Windows cells, see [Windows Stemcells v1709.13 and Later](#1709-13) and [Windows Stemcells v1709.5-v1709.12](#1709-5).

### <a name="1709-13"></a> Windows Stemcells v1709.13 and Later

Windows stemcells v1709.13 and later support ephemeral disk. If you use Windows stemcell v1709.13 or later, you can configure the disk size of your Windows cells in the PAS for Windows tile.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The default root disk size of Windows stemcell v1709.13 and later is 30 GB.
If you use vSphere, you must create your own stemcell. Pivotal recommends setting the root disk size of your Windows stemcell for vSphere to 30 GB.
For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-windows-stemcell-builder/wiki/Creating-a-vSphere-Windows-Stemcell">Creating a vSphere Windows Stemcell</a>.</p>

### <a name="1709-5"></a> Windows Stemcells v1709.5-v1709.12

Windows stemcells v1709.5-v1709.12 do not support ephemeral disk. If you use one of these stemcells, the size of the root disk of your stemcell determines the minimum root disk size of any Windows VM that the BOSH Director can create from that stemcell. You cannot configure the disk size of your Windows cells. For more information, see the table below:

<table id='disk-sizes' border="1" class="nice" >
  <tr>
    <th>IaaS</th>
    <th>Windows stemcell v1709.5-v1709.12 disk size</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Azure</th>
    <td>30 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>AWS</th>
    <td>128 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>GCP</th>
    <td>100 GB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>vSphere</th>
    <td>Recommended 128 GB+<sup>*</sup></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<sup>*</sup> Because you create your own stemcell on vSphere, you can control its root disk size. For more information, see [Creating a vSphere Windows Stemcell](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-windows-stemcell-builder/wiki/Creating-a-vSphere-Windows-Stemcell).

#### Select Diego Cell Disk Sizes

When you deploy or upgrade PAS for Windows, configure the resources of the BOSH Director and PAS for Windows as follows:

1. On the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, select **Pivotal Application Service for Windows**.

1. In the **Settings** tab, select **Resource Config**.

1. In the **VM Type** field, ensure that **Windows Diego Cell** has a minimum disk size according to the table above and your IaaS.

1. Click **Save**.

#### Select Master Compilation VM Disk Size

1. On the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, select the BOSH Director tile (usually the first tile).

1. In the **Settings** tab, select **Resource Config**.

1. In the **VM Type** field, ensure that the Ops Manager compilation VM has a minimum disk size according to the table above and your IaaS.

1. Click **Save**.


##<a id='stemcells'></a> Step 5: Upload the Stemcell

1. On the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, in **Pivotal Application Service for Windows**, click on **Missing Stemcell**. You will be taken to the **Stemcell Library.**

1. Retrieve the stemcell that you downloaded or created in [Downloading or Creating a Windows Stemcell](./stemcells.html).

1. Follow the steps in [Importing and Managing Stemcells](../opsguide/managing-stemcells.html) to upload the Windows stemcell to **Pivotal Application Service for Windows.**

##<a id='deploy'></a> Step 6: Deploy the Tile

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to install the PAS for Windows tile.


##<a id='copy'></a> Step 7: (Optional) Create More Tiles

If you want to run Windows cells in multiple isolation segments, you must create and configure additional PAS for Windows tiles. See [Windows Cells in Isolation Segments](./isolation.html) for how to do this.
