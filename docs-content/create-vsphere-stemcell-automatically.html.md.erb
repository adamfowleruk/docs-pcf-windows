This topic describes how to create a BOSH stemcell for Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows on VMware vSphere.

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

Before you can deploy PAS for Windows on vSphere, you must create a BOSH stemcell for Windows, a versioned operating system image.
The BOSH stemcell that you create in this topic is based on Windows Server, version 1803.

To create a BOSH stemcell for Windows on vSphere, do the following:

1. [Create a Base VM for the BOSH Stemcell](#create-base-vm)
1. [Install Windows Updates](#install-windows-updates)
1. [Clone the Base VM](#clone-vm)
1. [Construct the BOSH Stemcell](#construct-stemcell)
1. [Package the BOSH Stemcell](#package-stemcell)
1. [Upload the BOSH Stemcell to Ops Manager](#upload-stemcell)

If you already have a BOSH stemcell for Windows on vSphere,
see [Monthly Stemcell Upgrades](#upgrade-stemcell).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

* A vSphere environment
* A Windows Server, version 1803 ISO
* `stembuild` from a release in [Stemcells for PCF (Windows)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells-windows-server) on Pivotal Network that corresponds to the operating system of your local host and the stemcell version that you want to build
* Microsoft [Local Group Policy Object Utility (LGPO)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319) downloaded to the same folder as your `stembuild`

##<a id='create-base-vm'></a>Step 1: Create a Base VM for the BOSH Stemcell

This section describes how to create, configure, and verify a base VM for Windows

###<a name='verify-os'></a>Verify OS

To verify that you are using the correct OS version, run the following PowerShell command on the base VM:

```
Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object
Caption, Version, ServicePackMajorVersion, OSArchitecture, CSName, WindowsDirectory
```

The output should include `Version: 10.0.17134`.

###<a name='install-vmware-tools'></a>Install VMware Tools

To install VMware Tools on the base VM, do the following:

1. In the vSphere Web Client, right-click the base VM and select **Guest OS** > **Install VMware Tools**.
1. Navigate to the `D:` drive and run `setup64.exe`.
1. Restart the VM to complete the installation.

##<a id='install-windows-updates'></a>Step 2: Install Windows Updates

Install Windows updates on the base VM using your preferred procedure.
For example, you can install Windows updates by following the steps below. This procedure requires internet access.

1. On the base VM, run the **SConfig** utility.
1. Select **Download and Install Updates**.
1. Enter **A** to search for all updates.
1. For **Select an option**, enter **A** to install all updates.

You may need to restart the base VM while installing the updates.

##<a id='clone-vm'></a>Step 3: Clone the Base VM

To clone the base VM, do the following in the vSphere Web Client:

1. Power down the base VM.
1. Right-click the base VM.
1. Select **Clone** > **Clone to Virtual Machine**. This clone is your target VM.
  <%= image_tag('clone-vm.png') %>
1. Save the base VM. You will run Windows updates on this VM for future stemcells.

##<a id='construct-stemcell'></a>Step 4: Construct the BOSH Stemcell

Before constructing the BOSH stemcell, collect the following information:

* Target VM IP address
* Target VM username
* Target VM password
* vCenter inventory path to the target VM in the `/MY-DATA-CENTER/vm/MY-FOLDER/MY-VM` format where:
  * `MY-DATA-CENTER` is the name of the data center.
  * `vm` is a static string.
  * `MY-FOLDER` is the name of the folder that contains the VM.
  * `MY-VM` is the name of the target VM.
* vCenter username
* vCenter password
* vCenter URL

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The target VM must be routable from your local host. Before running the <code>construct</code> command, ensure you are logged out of the target VM.</p>

To construct the BOSH stemcell, run the following command from your local host:

```
./STEMBUILD-BINARY construct -vm-ip 'TARGET-VM-IP' -vm-username 'TARGET-USERNAME' -vm-password 'TARGET-VM-PASSWORD' -vcenter-url 'VCENTER-URL' -vcenter-username 'VCENTER-USERNAME' -vcenter-password 'VCENTER-PASSWORD' -vm-inventory-path 'INVENTORY-PATH'
```

Where:

* `STEMBUILD-BINARY` is the `stembuild` file for the version of your local host operating system and the
version of the stemcell that you want to build. For example, `stembuild-windows-1803-7`.
* `TARGET-VM-IP` is the IP address of your target VM.
* `TARGET-USERNAME` is the username of an account with Administrator privileges.
* `TARGET-VM-PASSWORD` is the password for the Administrator account. The password must be enclosed in single quotes.
* `VCENTER-URL` is the URL of your vCenter.
* `VCENTER-USERNAME` is the username of your account in vCenter.
* `VCENTER-PASSWORD` is your password. The password must be enclosed in single quotes.
* `INVENTORY-PATH` is the vCenter inventory path to the target VM.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This operation may take up to an hour to complete and results in a powered-off target Windows VM in your vSphere environment.
During <code>construct</code> execution, the WinRM connection terminates. This behavior is expected, and the <code>construct</code> command is still being executed.
Do not attempt to re-run the <code>construct</code> command.</p>

If you want to view the status of `construct`, you can log in to the target VM and do the following:

1. Start PowerShell.
1. Run the following command:

    ```
    Get-Content -Path "C:\provision\log.log" -Wait
    ```

##<a id='package-stemcell'></a>Step 5: Package the BOSH Stemcell

Before packaging the BOSH stemcell, collect the following information:

* vCenter inventory path to the target VM in the `/MY-DATA-CENTER/vm/MY-FOLDER/MY-VM` format where:
  * `MY-DATA-CENTER` is the name of the data center.
  * `vm` is a static string.
  * `MY-FOLDER` is the name of the folder that contains the VM.
  * `MY-VM` is the name of the target VM.
* vCenter username
* vCenter password
* vCenter URL

To package the BOSH stemcell, run the following command from your local host:

```
./STEMBUILD-BINARY package -vcenter-url 'VCENTER-URL' -vcenter-username 'VCENTER-USERNAME' -vcenter-password 'VCENTER-PASSWORD' -vm-inventory-path 'INVENTORY-PATH'
```

Where:

* `STEMBUILD-BINARY` is the `stembuild` file for the version of your local host operating system and the
version of the stemcell that you want to build. For example, `stembuild-windows-1803-7`.
* `VCENTER-URL` is the URL of your vCenter.
* `VCENTER-USERNAME` is the username of your account in vCenter.
* `VCENTER-PASSWORD` is your password. The password must be enclosed in single quotes.
* `INVENTORY-PATH` is the vCenter inventory path to the target VM.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This command creates a stemcell on your local host in the folder where you ran the command and may
take up to 30 minutes to complete.</p>

##<a id='upload-stemcell'></a>Step 6: Upload the BOSH Stemcell to Ops Manager

To upload the BOSH stemcell to Ops Manager, do the following:

1. In Ops Manager, navigate to **Stemcell Library**.
1. Upload your BOSH stemcell.
1. Deploy the PAS for Windows tile.

##<a id='upgrade-stemcell'></a>Monthly Stemcell Upgrades

After Microsoft releases operating system updates, you should upgrade your BOSH stemcell. Microsoft typically
releases Windows updates on the second Tuesday of each month.

To upgrade your BOSH stemcell, do the following:

1. [Install Windows Updates](#install-windows-updates) on the base VM.
1. [Clone the Base VM](#clone-vm).
1. [Construct the BOSH Stemcell](#construct-stemcell).
1. [Package the BOSH Stemcell](#package-stemcell).
1. Replace the existing stemcell in the Ops Manager stemcell library with this new stemcell.
1. Deploy the PAS for Windows tile.
